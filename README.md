# Keras-TensorFlow

Built a simple deep learning model. Explore the many powerful pre-trained deep learning models included in Keras and explored how to use them. Discovered how to deploy Keras models, and how to transfer data between Keras and TensorFlow to take advantage of all the TensorFlow tools while using Keras. Also uploaded the trained model to google cloud and accessed it to predict values
